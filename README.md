# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-using-Autoencoders-in-Keras
**Overview**
This project demonstrates the use of a Deep Autoencoder, implemented in Keras, to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. The model is trained on non-fraudulent (normal) transactions and learns to reconstruct their patterns. Fraudulent transactions are then identified as deviations from these patterns based on reconstruction errors.
